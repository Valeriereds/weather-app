## Description

This weather forecasting page was a very neat project, that I heartily enjoyed making. Everything implemented on this page through javascript/html were from the knowledge and skills I picked up during the course of my coding bootcamp. While I'm very brand new to the world of server-side APIs, using the openweatherAPI was one of the easiest parts of this endeavor. The hardest part had to be maintaining local storage from the user's cache and keeping it rendered to the page after linking it to the search history buttons. And naming all the variables to where I could understand them and have them be fun to look at constantly. I also had a bit of issues trying to format the date given from the data pulled from the api, and displaying it neatly onto the page. The most enjoyable part of this process was learning how to adhere the icons to the appropriate weather. But through frantic googling, I found the answer to MOST of my problems. I'm still learning, though, and with time, google and expertise, I hope to come back to this project with the answers to its problems. I hope this webpage can help any users needing a very simplistic, straight forward five day forecast.

## Usage



https://valeriereds.github.io/weather-app/

To use the Weather Forecast page, start by clicking on the search bar and typing in whatever city you'd like to see the weather for. After clicking search, the appropriate weather data should display on the main content container, as well as the five day outlook cards. If you wish to search for another city, simply click the x given on the right of the inside of the search bar, then add the next city you would like. If you'd like to see a previous searched city's outlook, just simply press the city's button under the "Showing Results For" header, and the information should display again. Refreshing the page should keep the user's search history rendered as buttons on the page.

Throughout this project, I referenced openweathermapAPI documentation whenever I ran into any issues.
